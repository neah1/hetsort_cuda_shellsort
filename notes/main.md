### TODOs: Benchmarking
- Setup benchmarking framework for comparing algorithms, including graphs.
- Create methods to generate datasets with different distribution according to essay for testing.
- For GPU sorting only, measure end-to-end VS GPU only sorting time
- Use GB size instead of arraysize
- Test memory transfer time vs shellsort sorting time
- Optimize shellsort kernel
- Compare with paradis
- In hetsort, time transfer vs gpu sort time

- limitations: lack of c++ knowledge. Rewriting due to bad practices discovered during optimization.
